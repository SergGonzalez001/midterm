            <p class="lead">FBI special agents investigate unexplained, mind-bending 
                cases known as "X-Files." Though the government is convinced 
                that the outlandish reports are false, conspiracy theorist Fox 
                Mulder (David Duchovny) and realist Dana Scully 
                (Gillian Anderson), for most of the series, stop at nothing to 
                prove that "the truth is out there." Series creator Chris Carter 
                also serves as executive producer of the thrilling 
                pop-culture phenomenon.</p>
